# Participation 11 :bookmark: 

Hi! Welcome to Qi Yang's Participation 11 of the course STAT 545A. :smile:

There is 1 **.R** script and 2 folders in this folder:
1. **cm011.R**: What I did following Lesson 11 in Guide after class.
2. Folder **Before_tutorial**: This folder contains what I did in class before the tutorial updated. It contains **gapminder_test.R** and **test.R**, the R scripts we created during class.
3. Folder **data**: Created during running **cm**.R.

Thanks for viewing my Participation 11!
