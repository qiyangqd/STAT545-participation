# Participation 03 :bookmark: 

Hi! Welcome to Qi Yang's Participation 03 of the course STAT 545A. :smile:

There are 3 folders in this folder:
1. **navigating_github**: **.md**, [**.html**](https://qiyangqd.github.io/STAT545-participation/CM03/navigating_github/navigating_github.html), **.pdf** files.

2. **rmd_exploration**: **.rmd**(raw codes), [**.html**](https://qiyangqd.github.io/STAT545-participation/CM03/rmd_exploration/rmd_exploration.html), **.md** files. 
* I cannot produce a .pdf file, as RStudio found "functions that produce HTML output" and "however HTML file will not be visible in non-HTML formats".

3. Folder **rmd_exploration_slides**: **.md**, [**.html**](https://qiyangqd.github.io/STAT545-participation/CM03/rmd_exploration_slides/rmd_exploration_slides.html) files.

Thanks for viewing my Participation 03!
