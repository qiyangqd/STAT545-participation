# Participation Repository for STAT 545A :bookmark: 

## What is this?
* Hi! My name is **Qi Yang**, a first-year PhD student in Oceanography at University of British Columbia (UBC). I focus on **marine viruses** and their ecological roles in the oceans. I have just started learning **R** and will use this tool in my study.

* This is my participation repository for the course **STAT 545A** at UBC. It is used to store the files I worked on during class meetings. We had 14 class meetings, and files for each class are put in corresponding folders. For instance, files made in **Class Meeting 01** are put in **CM01**. The content can be found below.

## Content
Below are the quick links to the **.html** or **.R script** output of each class meeting mainly. If you want to know more about my participation, please open the folder you are interested in to find a brief introduction and some other files like **.rmd**.
